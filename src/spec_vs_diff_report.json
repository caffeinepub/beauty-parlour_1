REQ-10’s WhatsApp target number is configured in `frontend/src/config/whatsapp.ts`, and `WhatsAppCTA` opens a wa.me link in a new tab without showing an alert. However, the diff summary does not include the Hero section implementation, so it cannot be verified from provided evidence that the Hero WhatsApp CTA specifically opens the new-tab wa.me link as required.",
